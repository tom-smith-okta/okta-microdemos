This demo shows SSO from Okta to AWS.
<br>
The Okta app is a "vanilla" SAML app that calls a SAML inline hook.
<br>
The SAML inline hook sends the user info (including group membership) to an external service.
<br>
The external service looks at the user's group memberships and sends back to Okta a patch with the AWS accounts and roles to be included in the SAML assertion.

Then, click on the link for "AWS - raw SAML with inline hook". Diana will arrive at the AWS console.
