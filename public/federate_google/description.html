This demo shows social login with Google using the Okta widget.<br>
Log in as a user, and you will get an Okta session and an id token.
<br>
The id token will be in local storage.<br>
This example flow is using the OAuth implicit flow for demo purposes.<br>
In production, you should generally use the OAuth code flow (preferably with PKCE) whenever possible.</br>
