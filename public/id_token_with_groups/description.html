This demo shows a simple OIDC authentication flow using the Okta widget.<br>
Log in as a user, and you will get an Okta session and an id token. The id token will include the user's group memberships.<br>
The id token will be in local storage.<br>
If you don't have a user yet, use the <a href = "/self_reg_widget">self-registration demo</a> to create one.<br>
This example flow is using the OAuth implicit flow for demo purposes.<br>
In production, you should generally use the OAuth code flow (preferably with PKCE) whenever possible.</br>
