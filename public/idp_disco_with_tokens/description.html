This demo shows an example of IDP discovery using the Okta widget, and also federation via OIDC to another Okta tenant.<br>

After authenticating, the user will have a session in both tenants, and will have tokens in local storage as well.<br>

<b>What to do</b>

<ul>
	<li>Launch the widget.</li>
	<li>enter username nick.fury@idpx.com</li>
	<li>you will be redirected to idpx.oktapreview.com</li>
	<li>enter the password for nick.fury@idpx.com</li>
	<li>you will be redirected back to this page</li>
	<li>you will have a session with both Okta tenants</li>
	<li>you will get an id token and an access token</li>
</ul>
