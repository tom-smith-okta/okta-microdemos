This demo shows an example self-registration flow and MFA enrollment with Okta, using the Okta widget.<br>

<b>What to do</b><br>

<ul>
	<li>Click on "login / register" to show the widget</li>
	<li>At the bottom of the widget, you will see "Don't have an account? Sign up"</li>
	<li>Click on "Sign up" to launch the self-registration form</li>
	<li>Enter an email address with "@mfa.com" to trigger the MFA enrollment flow.</li>
</ul>

After registering and enrolling in MFA, you will have an Okta session.<br>

For demo purposes, this user will be prompted for MFA every time they sign in, but this policy can of course be adjusted.<br>
