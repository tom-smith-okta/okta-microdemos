This demo shows a simple front-end integration with Segment.<br>
The Segment js library will send anonymous user data to Segment.<br>
The page will be listening for the Okta widget to fire a successful authentication. When this happens, the page will send an <pre>analytics.identify</pre> event to Segment with the user's information.
